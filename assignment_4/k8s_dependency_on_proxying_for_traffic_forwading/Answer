Q. Why Kubernetes relies on proxying to forward inbound traffic to backends ?

A. Kubernetes relies on proxying to forward inbould traffic to backends because
   we often expose services for our applications running inside pods. These 
   services have their IP called cluster-ip, so whenever someone accesses the 
   services it has to be forwarded to the concerned pod. Kubernetes ensures that
   these service ips/ cluster ips are mapped to the concerned pods by using 
   kube-proxy. Whenever an endpoint gets created the kube-proxy creates an IP table
   forwading rule(in case of ip table mode)/ rules in data link layer(in case of IPVS
   mode), so that the traffic bound for the Serviceâ€™s IP:Port is proxied to an 
   appropriate backend without the clients knowing anything about Kubernetes or 
   Services or Pods.
